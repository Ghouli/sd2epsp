SD-card floppy emulator for Epson PX-4 and PX-8 personal computers. Implements Epson serial protocol on AVR, meant to be used with Arduino Nano but can be modified to work on other boards. Currently supports up to four disk images spread on four drives, future plans include some way to change and browse disk images from the computer.

Still needs some work, waiting for parts to arrive so I can actually test this.
